During the course of these pages it is impossible to guess which way the story will turn, and I was kept on the edge of my seat in a constant rollercoaster of psychology, intellect, daring, beautiful imagery, adventure and deep thought processes, to name a few.</p>

                <p>Throughout this true story, Steven has seamlessly merged many worlds, from wild adventure to the ecosphere of a coma, from the high drama of life lived on a knife’s edge, to the overcoming of adversity in the form of total blindness.

                <p>He has taken me on a journey into domains I had no idea existed and has shown me the lighter side of life, in situations appearing too dark to be laughed at. He has given me a totally different perspective on how to move forward when life seems difficult to face. Above all, it is entertainment at its best.</p>
                            
                <p>Journey Through The Mirror has a stand alone style and it is fair to say, it is unique.</p>
